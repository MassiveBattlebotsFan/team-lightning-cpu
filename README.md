# PL2 vCPU    
This is the home of my experimental C++ virtual CPU.    
See [documentation.md](documentation.md) for opcodes and instructions for extending the CPU.

## Building   
Assuming I didn't break anything, and you're not on a Mac, and you have g++ installed, `make` should compile this project.

## TODO  
* Make ROM system sub module that allows having an RW filesystem
* Update the EsoLangs page, and fix documentation
* Add example programs
